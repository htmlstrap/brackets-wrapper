brackets-wrapper
================

Extension for [Brackets Code Editor](http://brackets.io/ "Brackets"). <br /> 
Wrap selected text with braces, curly-braces, parentheses, quotes and double quotes just like Sublime Text does. If no text selected, pressed symbol would be completed with closing symbol ('{' with '}' and so forth)
